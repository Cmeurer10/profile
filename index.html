              <h3>Glass Animals</h3>
              <p>How to Be a Human Being is the second studio album by English indie rock group Glass Animals.
                It was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and Caroline International in Europe, and Harvest
                Records in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its "sense of wonder", and
                "immediate impression", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt it was
                somewhat premature.</p>

                the United Kingdom on 8 April 2011 by Because Music. Following the release of their last album
                Nights Out in 2008, original member Gabriel Stebbing left the band - from this album, Gbenga
                Adelekan had joined on bass and Anna Prior had joined on drums. However, Stebbing recorded the
                bass parts on the album prior to his departure.</p>

                professionally known as La Roux. It was released on 18 July 2014 by Polydor Records. La Roux
                originally consisted of Jackson and producer Ben Langmaid, who collaborated during the earlier
                stages of production. However, Jackson was left to complete the record in early 2014 after
                Langmaid departed from the group in early 2012.</p>
